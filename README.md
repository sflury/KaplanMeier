# KaplanMeier

Statistical assessments with the Kaplan-Meier survival function (lower/upper limits) to test whether a measured value `x0` (typically the mean of a distribution) is associated with some population `x`, accounting for lower limits in `x`. If the Kaplan-Meier survival function at `x0` is outside the limits of 0.01 to 0.99, one can confidently reject the null hypothesis that the measurement `x0` is associated with the measurements `x`.

I originally developed and implemented this script for Flury et al. 2024
for tests involving a sample of 89 Lyman continuum measurements,
39 of which were upper limits requiring the censoring treatment of
the Kaplan-Meier survival curve.

## Examples
``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from numpy.random import seed,rand,randn
from KaplanMeier import *

seed(123)
x = randn(100)
c = rand(100)<0.3
x0 = array([1.65])
x0_err = array([[0.3],[0.5]])

km_x,km_y = km_curve(x,c)
p_x,p_e = km_eval(x0,x,c,x0_err=x0_err)
```
which gives the results below
